               We're currently solving the following issue within our           
         repository. Here's the issue text:                                     
               ISSUE:                                                           
               {issue}                                                          
                                                                                
               INSTRUCTIONS:                                                    
               Now, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal 
         session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You 
         can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit   
         all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.   
               Remember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should   
         always wait for feedback after every command.                          
               When you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you   
         can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit  
         command.                                                               
               Note however that you cannot use any interactive session commands
         (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and  
         run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with      
         `python <script_name>.py`.                                             
                                                                                
               NOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When    
         editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each
         line!                                                                  
                                                                                
               IMPORTANT TIPS:                                                  
               1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues   
         discusses.                                                             
                  If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we        
         recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to
         make sure you can reproduce the bug.                                   
                  Then start trying to fix it.                                  
                  When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug           
         reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.   
                                                                                
                  If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it
         successfully runs, we recommend adding a print("Script completed       
         successfully, no errors.") command at the end of the file,             
                  so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all   
         the way through.                                                       
                                                                                
               2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a       
         different command. A command that did not work once will not work the  
         second time unless you modify it!                                      
                                                                                
               3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a        
         specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't  
         just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 
         583 command. It's much quicker.                                        
                                                                                
               4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a   
         specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand   
         how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to 
         see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the 
         command: find_file "buggy-input.png" If that doesn't work, use the     
         linux 'find' command.                                                  
                                                                                
               5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the   
         current working directory (which appears right after the currently open
         file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than  
         the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open 
         files, so they might change the current  open file.                    
                                                                                
               6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong
         line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check  
         the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you
         wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.   
                                                                                
               7. It may be necessary to install the repository from source     
         before you can run code. Please think about how to install the         
         environment from the repository directory if you need to do so.        
                                                                                
                                                                                
               (Open file: {open_file})                                         
               (Current directory: {working_dir})

               SETTING: You are an autonomous programmer, and you're working    
         directly in the command line with a special interface.                 
                                                                                
               The special interface consists of a file editor that shows you   
         {WINDOW} lines of a file at a time.                                    
               In addition to typical bash commands, you can also use the       
         following commands to help you navigate and edit files.                
                                                                                
               COMMANDS:                                                        
               {command_docs}                                                   
                                                                                
               Please note that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION.   
               If you'd like to add the line '        print(x)' you must fully  
         write that out, with all those spaces before the code! Indentation is  
         important and code that is not indented correctly will fail and require
         fixing before it can be run.                                           
                                                                                
               RESPONSE FORMAT:                                                 
               Your shell prompt is formatted as follows:                       
               (Open file: <path>) <cwd> $                                      
                                                                                
               You need to format your output using two fields; discussion and  
         command.                                                               
               Your output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_     
         command field EXACTLY as in the following example:                     
               DISCUSSION                                                       
               First I'll start by using ls to see what files are in the current
         directory. Then maybe we can look at some relevant files to see what   
         they look like.                                                        
               ```                                                              
               ls -a                                                            
               ```                                                              
                                                                                
               You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section
         and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more
         discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION      
         section will be saved for future reference.                            
               If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO    
         THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then     
         after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command. 
               You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find,  
         grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.   
               However, the environment does NOT support interactive session    
         commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.

         <replacement text> will be entered, so make sure your indentation is   
         formatted properly. Python files will be checked for syntax errors     
         after the edit. If the system detects a syntax error, the edit will not
         be executed. Simply try to edit the file again, but make sure to read  
         the error message and modify the edit command you issue accordingly.   
         Issuing the same command a second time will just lead to the same error
         message again.

         Please note that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION.         
         If you'd like to add the line '        print(x)' you must fully write  
         that out, with all those spaces before the code! Indentation is        
         important and code that is not indented correctly will fail and require
         fixing before it can be run.                                           
                                                                                
         RESPONSE FORMAT:                                                       
         Your shell prompt is formatted as follows:                             
         (Open file: <path>) <cwd> $                                            
                                                                                
         You need to format your output using two fields; discussion and        
         command.                                                               
         Your output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_ command   
         field EXACTLY as in the following example:                             
         DISCUSSION                                                             
         First I'll start by using ls to see what files are in the current      
         directory. Then maybe we can look at some relevant files to see what   
         they look like.                                                        
         ```                                                                    
         ls -a                                                                  
         ```                                                                    
                                                                                
         You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and  
         then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more    
         discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION      
         section will be saved for future reference.                            
         If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT!    
         Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after     
         receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.       
         You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep,  
         cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.         
         However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands 
         (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.

         **Describe the bug**                                                   
         I was using pvlib for sometime now and until now I was always passing a
         big dataframe containing readings of a long period. Because of some    
         changes in our software architecture, I need to pass the weather       
         readings as a single reading (a dataframe with only one row) and I     
         noticed that for readings that GHI-DHI are zero pvlib fails to         
         calculate the output and returns below error while the same code       
         executes correctly with weather information that has non-zero GHI-DHI: 
         ```python

         I have to mention that for now the workaround that I am using is to    
         pass the weather data as a dataframe with two rows, the first row is a 
         good weather data that pvlib can process and the second row is the     
         incoming weather reading (I can also post that code if you want).      
                                                                                
         **Expected behavior**                                                  
         PVlib should have consistent behavior and regardless of GHI-DHI        
         readings.

         Now, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal       
         session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You 
         can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit   
         all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.   
         Remember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always  
         wait for feedback after every command.                                 
         When you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can     
         submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit      
         command.                                                               
         Note however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g.
         python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run    
         them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python  
         <script_name>.py`.                                                     
                                                                                
         NOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a
         file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!    
                                                                                
         IMPORTANT TIPS:                                                        
         1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues         
         discusses.                                                             
            If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend    
         that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure
         you can reproduce the bug.                                             
            Then start trying to fix it.                                        
            When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction    
         script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.                
                                                                                
            If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it      
         successfully runs, we recommend adding a print("Script completed       
         successfully, no errors.") command at the end of the file,             
            so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way 
         through.                                                               
                                                                                
         2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different   
         command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time
         unless you modify it!                                                  
                                                                                
         3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line
         that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the   
         scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. 
         It's much quicker.                                                     
                                                                                
         4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific
         file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to     
         input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see    
         whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the     
         command: find_file "buggy-input.png" If that doesn't work, use the     
         linux 'find' command.                                                  
                                                                                
         5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current 
         working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). 
         The currently open file might be in a different directory than the     
         working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open     
         files, so they might change the current  open file.                    
                                                                                
         6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line 
         number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the   
         code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you    
         wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.   
                                                                                
         7. It may be necessary to install the repository from source before you
         can run code. Please think about how to install the environment from   
         the repository directory if you need to do so.

         To begin addressing the issue, we should first try to replicate the bug
         using the provided code snippet. We'll create a new Python script file,
         paste the code into it, and run the script to see if we can reproduce  
         the error.

         It appears that the `pandas` module is not installed in this           
         environment. Since we cannot directly install packages in this         
         environment, we'll need to simulate the environment where the code is  
         expected to run. This typically involves installing the package from   
         the source.                                                            
                                                                                
         Let's check if there's a `setup.py` file in the repository that we can 
         use to install the package and its dependencies.

         It seems that the execution of the `pip install` command has timed out,
         which indicates that we might not be able to install packages directly 
         in this environment. Since we cannot install the `pandas` module or any
         other dependencies, we'll need to proceed with a different approach.   
                                                                                
         Given that we cannot install packages, we should instead focus on the  
         code and the error message provided in the issue to identify the       
         potential cause of the problem. The error message indicates that the   
         golden-section search fails when the upper and lower bounds are equal, 
         which is likely happening when GHI-DHI readings are zero.              
                                                                                
         Let's look for the implementation of the golden-section search within  
         the `pvlib` codebase to see if we can identify and fix the issue. We'll
         start by searching for the function or method that contains the        
         golden-section search logic.                                           
                                                                                
         Since the error message mentioned `pvlib/tools.py`, we should check    
         this file first. Let's open `tools.py` and look for the relevant code.

         We have located the section of the `tools.py` file that contains the   
         golden-section search algorithm. The error message from the issue      
         indicates that the problem occurs when the upper and lower bounds are  
         equal, which can lead to a divide by zero error or an infinite loop.   
                                                                                
         The code snippet from the issue suggests that the error occurs when    
         GHI, DHI, and DNI are all zero. This could cause the upper and lower   
         bounds for the optimization to be equal, which is not handled by the   
         current implementation of the golden-section search.                   
                                                                                
         To address this issue, we need to add a check to handle the case when  
         the upper and lower bounds are equal. If they are equal, the function  
         should return without attempting the optimization, as there is no range
         to search within.                                                      
                                                                                
         Let's edit the `_golden_sect_DataFrame` function to handle this case.

         The error message indicates that the `h5py` module is not installed in 
         this environment. Since we cannot install additional Python packages in
         this environment, we'll have to proceed without being able to run the  
         script directly.                                                       
                                                                                
         Given that we cannot run the script, we should ensure that our changes 
         to the code are logically sound and address the issue described. The   
         edit we made to `tools.py` should prevent the golden-section search    
         from failing when the upper and lower bounds are equal by returning the
         lower bound and a NaN for the function value.                          
                                                                                
         Since we've made the necessary changes and logically addressed the     
         issue, the next step would be to submit these changes. However, in a   
         real-world scenario, it would be important to run tests to confirm that
         the changes fix the issue without introducing new problems.            
                                                                                
         Let's proceed to submit our changes using the `submit` command.
